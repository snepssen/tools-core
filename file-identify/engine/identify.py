"""The ladder: cheap facts first, and stop as soon as the answer is settled.

The order is the design. Statting a file costs nothing, so everything gets
that. The extension costs nothing, so everything gets that too. Reading eight
kilobytes costs a seek, so it happens for everything but is the first thing
that can be skipped on a slow volume. Parsing a header costs a little more and
only happens for kinds that have one worth parsing.

Crucially the *name* is read after the kind is known, because the filename
detectors need to be told what they are looking at — an ungated music parser
reads an artist and a title out of a tax return. And provenance is read last
only because it is independent of everything else, not because it is weak: it
is frequently the strongest fact in the record.
