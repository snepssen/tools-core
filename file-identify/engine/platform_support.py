# auto-sort had exactly one third-party dependency for about a day: PyObjC,
# to put an icon in a Mac's menu bar. It is gone. The Objective-C runtime is
# a plain C library and `ctypes` speaks C, so `tray.py` now talks to it
# directly the way the Windows backend always did.
#
# That mattered for more than tidiness. PyObjC cannot be installed at all on
# a Homebrew, Debian or Fedora Python -- they are marked externally managed
# under PEP 668 and refuse `pip install` -- so the icon was unreachable on
# the machines most likely to run this, and working around it meant auto-sort
# building and owning a forty-megabyte virtual environment. Removing the
# dependency removed the whole problem and about two hundred lines with it.
#
# These two functions remain because `bootstrap` and the tests ask, and
# because an honest empty answer is worth more than a missing one.
