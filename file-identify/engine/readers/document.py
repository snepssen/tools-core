"""Who wrote it, with what, and how long it is.

The producer string is the fact worth having. A PDF whose `/Producer` is a
scanner's firmware is a piece of paper somebody scanned; one produced by Word
is something they wrote; one produced by a browser's print dialogue is a
receipt or a ticket. That single field separates three piles that otherwise
look identical from the outside, and it is free.

Page counts come second, and honestly: a PDF that stores its page tree in a
compressed object stream will not give one up without a real parser, so the
count is reported when the file volunteers it and left absent when it does
not. An absent page count costs a rule; a wrong one costs a misfiled document.
