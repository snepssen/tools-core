"""Reading what a PDF actually says, with nothing but zlib.

A file called `scan0001.pdf` tells a sorter nothing, and neither does
`Document1.pdf` or `20090314.pdf`. That is not an edge case: it is what a
decade of bank portals, scanner drivers and Windows "Save As" dialogues
produced, and those files are exactly the ones somebody is required to keep
for twenty-five years. The filename is a dead end and the metadata usually
is too. The words on the page are the only thing left.

Getting at them is less work than it sounds. A PDF's page content is a
stream of drawing operators, the streams are almost always compressed with
zlib, and the text-showing operators take their argument as a plain string.
There is no need to lay out a page, resolve a font or build an object graph
to find out that the first thing on it is the word `Rechnung`.

What this deliberately does not do is pretend to be a PDF library. It does
not resolve cross-reference tables, follow object streams, decrypt, or apply
any filter but Flate. Each of those would be real work in aid of a question
nobody asks a file sorter, and every one of them can fail on a malformed
file. When this cannot read a document it says so and the document keeps the
facts it already had.

The other half of the job is knowing when there is nothing to read. A page
that was scanned as an image carries no text at all, and saying "no
paperwork keywords found" about it would be a lie -- the right answer is
"this needs eyes, or OCR". Those two outcomes are reported separately.

    Text drawn with a subset-encoded CID font comes back as byte pairs that

    as text, because a keyword search over noise eventually finds a keyword.

    This used to ask whether letters made up 45% of the *characters*, and
    that was wrong in a way that cost a great deal. An invoice is full of
    amounts, dates, customer numbers and reference codes:

        chars: 62994   letters: 22425   ratio: 0.36   ->  rejected
        words with letters: 3035

    Three thousand words of German, thrown away for being 36% letters. On

    twenty distinct heading words -- five of which headed 171 of the 177,
    because they were all from the same sender and all said the same thing
    at the top. Every one of those was then held as an unreadable scan.

    So: count *words*, not characters. Two-byte CID codes come back as
    control characters, which are turned into spaces before this is asked,
    so they produce almost no words and are still refused.

    Counting words is not enough on its own, though, and the folder that
    proved it had 172 files in it -- see `_glyph_codes` below.

    What none of this can tell apart is a one-byte subset font whose
    encoding is a substitution of the *same alphabet* -- real words with
    the letters swapped. That is a cipher of prose and has the shape of
    prose, so no test without a dictionary will catch it. The cost if it
