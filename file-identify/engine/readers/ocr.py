"""Reading a page that was photographed rather than typed.

Some documents have no text in them at all. A page put through a scanner is
a picture of words, and every rule this program has -- the induction that
learns what a household's post calls itself, the heading window, the whole
business of letting documents name their own categories -- needs characters
to work on. Without them a scan can only be held.

So: an **optional external program**, found at runtime the way `ffprobe` and
`exiftool` are meant to be, and never a dependency. Absent, nothing changes
and a scan is held exactly as before. Present, the page is read and the
existing induction does the rest, with no new vocabulary anywhere -- what
comes back is text, and this program already knows what to do with text.

Three things worth saying about the shape of it.

**What comes back is weaker evidence, and says so.** A heading lifted from a
text layer is what the document literally contains. A heading from OCR is a
machine's reading of a photograph of it, and `rn` becomes `m` at any
resolution somebody's fax ever used. It is recorded at LIKELY where a text
layer is STRONG, which is the confidence model doing exactly what it exists
for rather than a special case.

**It runs where it can be killed.** OCR is seconds of somebody else's C
code on somebody else's file, which is the definition of the work the
identify worker exists to contain. It gets its own timeout well inside the
worker's, so that a page that will not finish costs one file rather than a
restart.

**It is off unless it is installed.** No download, no bundled model, no
"enable OCR?" dialogue on first run. Installing `tesseract` is the switch,
and `ocr = off` in the rules file is there for somebody who has it installed
for other reasons and does not want minutes of processor time spent on a
folder of holiday photographs of menus.
