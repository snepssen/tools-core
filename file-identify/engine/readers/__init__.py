"""Tier 1: what a file's own header says about it, and Tier 2: what a
program somebody happened to install says about it.

One entry point. `read(peek, kind, fmt, record)` picks the reader for the kind
and lets it add facts, and every reader is allowed to decline — an unsupported
format, a truncated file, a header that does not parse — by returning False.
Nothing here raises: a file that cannot be read is a file with fewer facts,
not a sorting run that stops halfway through somebody's Downloads folder.
