"""What is known about an item, where each fact came from, and how sure it is.

Every decision auto-sort makes is made unattended, on somebody else's files,
and will be questioned later — usually by somebody looking at a file that
ended up somewhere surprising. So a fact is never just a value. It carries the
reader that established it and a confidence, and both survive into the log.

Three behaviours here do real work:

**A weaker source never overwrites a stronger one.** The extension says `.mp3`
and the header says FLAC; the header wins, and the disagreement is kept rather
than discarded, because "the extension lies" is itself something rules match on.

**Agreement raises confidence.** An artist name from an ID3 tag is strong. The
same artist name also parsed out of the filename makes it stronger, because two
independent readers would have to be wrong in the same direction. This is the
only way a filename-derived fact ever becomes trustworthy.

**Nothing is invented.** A fact that could not be established is absent, not
empty, not zero, not "unknown". Rules treat absence as "no match", so a
missing ffprobe narrows what can fire instead of making it fire wrongly.
