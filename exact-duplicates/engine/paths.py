"""Where things live, and how to write a filename that survives the journey.

Two jobs that look unrelated and are not. Both are about the destination's
rules rather than the source's: where a configuration file belongs on *this*
platform, and what a filename is allowed to contain on *that* volume.

The second one is where sorters break. A file called `AC/DC — Back in Black
?.flac` is perfectly legal on APFS and impossible on the FAT32 stick it is
being copied to, and a tool that discovers this at the point of writing has
already half-moved something. Names are sanitised against the filesystem they
are going *to*, before anything is attempted.
