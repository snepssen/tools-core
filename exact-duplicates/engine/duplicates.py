"""Recognising a file auto-sort has already filed somewhere else.

The ledger has recorded a sha256 for every file it has ever moved, and until
now did nothing with them. So `duplicate_of` was a fact no reader ever set,
and the rule written against it could never fire -- the information was
there, complete, and unused.

Duplicates mostly arrive by accident rather than intent. macOS has no cut and
paste for files, so moving one means copying it and then remembering to go
back and delete the original, and the second half is the half that does not
happen. Two identical files then sit in two places for no reason anybody
chose.

**Size first, hash second.** Hashing every file to find out whether it has
been seen before would make identification cost a full read of the disk. Two
files of different sizes cannot be identical, and size comes free from the
`stat` that has already happened -- so only a size collision is worth reading
for, and on a real ledger that is a small fraction of candidates.

**A duplicate is only a duplicate of something that still exists.** The
ledger remembers where a file was put, not where it is now: it may have been
moved, renamed or thrown away since. A match whose other copy has gone is not
reported, because there is nothing left for it to be a duplicate of.

Nothing here deletes anything, and nothing here decides what to do about a
duplicate. It sets a fact; a rule decides.

# one the sorter itself answers -- documents to Documents, music to Music --
# and a duplicate check that contradicted it would file a thing one way and
# tidy it the other.
