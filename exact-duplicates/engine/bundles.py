"""Grouping, because the thing being sorted is often not one file.

This is the part a file sorter gets wrong quietly. Moving `model.obj` without
`model.mtl` leaves a 3D model that opens grey. Moving a film without its `.srt`
loses the subtitles a person spent an evening finding. Moving the JPEG out of a
raw+JPEG pair separates two halves of one photograph. In every case the tool
looks like it worked.

So the scanner does not emit paths. It emits **items**, and an item is either
one file, one file with its sidecars, a directory the operating system treats
as a single document, or a numbered sequence of frames. Whatever the rules
decide, the whole item moves.

The grouping is by stem, which is what every program that writes a sidecar
actually uses. `Film.mkv`, `Film.en.srt`, `Film.nfo` and `Film-poster.jpg` all
begin with `Film`, and nothing more clever than that is needed or safe.
