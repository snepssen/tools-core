"""The folders the operating system already made, which mostly go unused.

Every desktop ships with Pictures, Movies, Music and Documents, and on most
machines they sit empty while everything the person owns piles up in
Downloads. auto-sort files into them rather than inventing a parallel
structure, because a second set of media folders beside the ones the system
already has is not tidying, it is another mess with a nicer name.

Finding them is a per-platform question and not a guess:

*Linux* has a specification for it. `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs` is written by
the desktop environment and is where a localised or relocated Pictures folder
is recorded -- `XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/Bilder"` -- so it is read rather than
assumed.

*Windows* keeps the same information in the registry, under Shell Folders,
which is how it survives somebody moving Documents onto another drive. The
standard library can read it.

*macOS* puts them at fixed English paths and localises only the display name,
so `~/Pictures` is correct even when Finder says `Bilder`.

The fallback everywhere is the English name under the home directory, which
is right far more often than it is wrong and is never destructive: a folder
that does not exist is created the first time something is filed into it.
