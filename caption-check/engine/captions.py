"""Reading the captions, and the ways they go wrong.

Three formats, because between them they are almost everything anybody
delivers: SubRip, WebVTT, and Advanced SubStation. They are parsed here rather
than rendered, because every fault worth catching before delivery — cues that
overlap, cues nobody can read in the time given, lines too long for the frame,
a font the machine does not have — is visible in the file itself.

What is *not* here is a judgement about wording, translation, or whether a
caption is a good caption. This module counts and measures. The thresholds
belong to the target, and reasonable people set them differently.

On reading speed
----------------
Characters per second is the measure most subtitling guidance is written in,
and it is a proxy: it knows nothing about vocabulary, language, or who is
watching. Seventeen characters a second is comfortable for most adult viewers
in English and far too fast for a child's programme. The number lives in the
profile, where it can be argued with, and the report says which number it used.
