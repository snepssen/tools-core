"""What a target format actually means, and what a container will hold.

Two kinds of fact live here and nothing else does:

  * the presets — "mp3" or "1080p" as a thing somebody can ask for, spelled
    out into the container and codecs it implies;
  * the container/codec compatibility table, which is what lets siphon tell
    the difference between a conversion and a rename.

That second one is the whole reason this file is separate from the ffmpeg
engine. "Give me this as an mp4" usually means the video is already h264 in a
webm wrapper and the only work needed is moving the streams into a new
container — seconds, and not a single pixel touched. Deciding that requires
knowing what mp4 is allowed to hold, which is a fact about the format, not
about ffmpeg.
